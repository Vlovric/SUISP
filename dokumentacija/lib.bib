At the same time, however, its security issues are exposed constantly and cyber attacks have caused significant losses in it. At present, there is little concern and research in the field of network security of the blockchain. This paper introduces the applications of blockchain in various fields, systematically analyzes the security of each layer of the blockchain and possible cyber attacks, expounds the challenges brought by the blockchain to network supervision, and summarizes research progress in the protection technology. This paper is a review of the current security of the blockchain and will effectively help the development and improvement of security technologies of the blockchain.},

	abstract = {Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify’s analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract’s dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language.},

	abstract = {Purpose – This paper concentrates on the comparison of security auditing tools specifying password cracking tools based on different matrices. Passwords are the most popular and dominant means of access control in every authentication process. Every password is vulnerable in the virtual world; all we can do is to delay it for one to break into us. Password cracking used in two opposite intentions; either it can be used for an administrator to protect from unauthorized access and for users to recover forgotten passwords or for an intruder to break into a secure system.
Method – A great number of attacks on many systems are related to passwords. Awkwardly, the randomness and length of user-chosen passwords remain the same over time, but in contrast, hardware enhancement continuously gives intruders increasing computational power. So, password cracking has been one of the favorite vulnerable aspects for intruders to gain access to any unauthorized system. Among all available freeware password cracking tools, we choose five renowned tools based on offline and online categories.
Results – Cain and Abel is the winner in the offline category, and TCH-Hydra is the winner in the online category in their performance among the tools we have tested.
Conclusion – In this paper, the data has been collected by testing each tool several times in different systems as well as all tools in the same system based on different matrices. We have come to a knowledgeable result by comparing data among themselves. The},

On the downside this has led to the exposure of more and more security issues and challenges, which has gained widespread attention in terms of research in the field of Ethereum smart contract vulnerabilities in both academia and industry. This article presents a survey of the Ethereum smart contract's various vulnerabilities and the corresponding defense mechanisms that have been applied to combat them. In particular, we focus on the random number vulnerability in the Fomo3d-like game contracts, as well as that attack and defense methods applied. Finally, we summarize the existing Ethereum smart contract security audit methods and compare several mainstream audit tools from various perspectives.},

	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
